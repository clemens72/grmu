            Itâ€™s a great place for networking, asking questions or getting advice on how to help your music career. It builds friendships while getting to know others in the business that can give you resources and/or collab with you on projects. All this and more while having a great time hanging out in a casual social environment. Thereâ€™s no structureâ€¦just fun. Most importantlyâ€¦.it makes our music community STRONGER!!!

            <Typography variant="h5" sx={{ mb: 4, textAlign: 'center' }}>
            Of course! Bring someone who you think could benefit from this. Also, not everyone is great at social situations alone and I get that! We encourage to keep the group a music scene gathering but there are always exceptions. If youâ€™d like to bring a non music friend/significant other as support weâ€™ll be happy to hang with them too! If youâ€™re a minor weâ€™ll expect youâ€™ll be bringing your parent or guardian since we usually meet where alcohol is being served.
